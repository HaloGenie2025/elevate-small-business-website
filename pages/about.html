    <!-- Main About Content -->
    <section class="about-main">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p class="intro-text">After 10 years managing and working in big transformation projects for large organisations, I had a realisation: the work I found most rewarding was the bit where I actually helped people solve their problems.</p>

                    <p>So I started Elevate Small Business to work directly with people who can actually make decisions and see changes happen immediately.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What I bring to the table:</h3>
                    <ul class="experience-list">
                        <li><strong>Process improvement expertise</strong> from turning manual Excel nightmares into proper systems</li>
                        <li><strong>Project management experience</strong> from managing million dollar projects</li>
                        <li><strong>Change management skills</strong> from creating training resources, creating new processes and procedures to rolling out new systems to 800+ workers across SA</li>
                        <li><strong>Sales and Marketing expertise</strong> from launching products and growing customer bases</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic planning skills</strong> from turning big picture vision into actionable roadmaps that small teams can actually execute</li>
                        <li><strong>Hands on financial management</strong> from MYOB setup to creating reports that tell you what's really happening in your business</li>
                        <li><strong>Roll up your sleeves mentality</strong> I'll tackle everything from organising your admin chaos to building your 5 year plan</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Why small business?</h3>
                    <p>Because when I help a small business owner streamline their operations, they go home to their family earlier. When I help them improve their cash flow, they sleep better. When I help them scale their systems, they can actually grow without burning out.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's the stuff that matters.</p>
                    
                    <p>Plus, small business owners are refreshingly direct. No politics, no hidden agendas - just "here's my problem, can you help fix it?"</p>
                    
                    <h3>When I'm not working:</h3>
                    <p>I'm a co-founder of a Technology Startup called HaloMap, and I volunteer with the Project Management Institute. When I'm not working or volunteering you'll find me spending time with my family.</p>
